# Server Mad Libs

This is a server mad libs game to be played in the classroom.

Each student deploys a server, and a text file gets passed around from one student's server to another.

The text file contains a story with placeholders like this: {{ noun }} , or this: {{ verb }}.

Each time the text file gets passed from one server to another, the placeholder must be replaced with an actual word.

What story will your class write?
